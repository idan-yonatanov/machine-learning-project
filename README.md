# Machine Learning Project ‚Äì Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains a machine learning project carried out as part of an academic course in Industrial Engineering and Management.  
The project focuses on sentiment analysis of social media messages using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## üìä Project Description
The project was divided into two main parts:

- **Part A ‚Äì Data Processing & Feature Engineering**  
  - Data collection and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature extraction, representation, and selection  
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA)  
  - Dataset validation  

- **Part B ‚Äì Model Training & Evaluation**  
  - Decision Tree classifier  
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Unsupervised Learning ‚Äì Clustering (K-Medoids with Gower distance)  
  - Model comparison and evaluation using AUC, ROC Curve, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix  
  - Model improvement with dimensionality reduction and bagging
